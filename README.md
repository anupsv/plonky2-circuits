# Plonky2 circuits

The goal of this project is to develop an elliptic curve math library parameterized for the following curves :
- secp256k1 
- BLS12-381

Expecting this to be a 2-week project from Sept 1 to Sept 15. 

### Plan for Sept 1st week

- Get the circuit structure from [MirProtocol/Plonky2](https://github.com/mir-protocol/plonky2) & ship some simple stuff.
- Go through simple [circuits](https://github.com/mir-protocol/plonky2/blob/main/plonky2/examples/fibonacci.rs)
- Go through the [Sha256](https://github.com/succinctlabs/btc-warp/blob/main/src/circuits/sha256.rs) implementation
- Go through rust elliptic curve libraries 
- Implement secp256k1
